## Hi,

Learning software is an art. But this art has certain criteria. After learning these criteria in order, you can go further to the software world than the "Hello World" article. In order to do this art well, it is necessary to take certain steps.
A road map that can be used to go further;
* Programming Skills;
  * https://udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/
  * https://udemy.com/course/advanced-topics-csharp/
  * https://udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet/
* .Net Framework
  * https://udemy.com/course/build-rest-apis-with-aspnet-core-web-api-entity-framework/
  * https://udemy.com/course/aspnet-6-course/
  * https://udemy.com/course/docker4dotnet/
* Soft Skills
  * https://adessoturkey.udemy.com/course/sorunlu-musteri-yonetimi/
  * https://adessoturkey.udemy.com/course/profesional-zaman-yonetimi/
  * https://adessoturkey.udemy.com/course/zaman-yonetimi-ve-onceliklenen/


If you apply this roadmap, it means that you have reached a certain level in software. In the roadmap, when making software under the heading of Soft Skills, the nature of the business involves customer management and it is necessary to use it well. Communicating with the people you work with is an important part of training. That's why I recommend you to watch the trainings under the title of Soft Skills.

I used the udemy site in education. In addition to these, you can choose different platforms such as github and linkedIn.

In order to support the software network, you can add topics to the topics that need to be learned and support them.
